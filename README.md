## About Me
I am a sophomore ('27) at Whitman College with a prospective combined major in Mathematics-Statistics and a minor in Psychology, with an interest in Criminology. I am a high school graduate of India International School in Japan ('22) and a former Minerva University student ('23). Outside of classes, I explore the field of crime and its statistics through books such as anecdotes of past cases and how statistics are calculated in crimes. I aspire to work with statistics in applications of psychology and/or criminology.

## Data Sources and Project Ideas
The following data sources are my ideas for a project on data analysis:
- [Real-Time Crime Index](https://realtimecrimeindex.com/)
  - Description: The FBI Crime Data Explorer takes forever to load for me, so I have decided to go through a website that directly sources from the FBI and other agencies. They present crime patterns in the form of a line graph for violent and property crimes, nationwide or among states.
  - Idea: Compare different categories of violent and property crimes between states to calculate the categorical crime statistic at any given point in time. From the statistics, create a predictive model that would generate a visualization of a potential crime pattern using previous trends.
- [Criminal Justice Research & Statistics Center: Washington Statistical Analysis Center](https://sac.ofm.wa.gov/data)
  - Description: The Washington Statistical Center provides state data for arrests, reported crimes, juvenile crime rates, prison admissions and population rates, and more. While they have online analyses for the statistics, they have also provided the raw data for personal analyses.
  - Idea: Using the raw data, create an animated heatmap across time for a category or the average of several. Using the animation, formulate hypotheses about trend patterns and predict future possibilities in crime rates. Additionally, analyze whether the area with the highest crime rate is generally the same or it varies depending on the year. Using this analysis, formulate a conclusion on potential reasons for the presence or absence of this change.
- [YRBSS Dataset in CSV](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/dash-youth-risk-behavior-surveillance-system-yrbss-high-school-excluding-sexual-identity/resource/53629af8-5bb5-49de-9497-65de830a2a6f)
  - Description: The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) monitors adolescent behavioral patterns to understand how youth programs for mental health can be improved. It measures six categories including basics such as demographics and behavioral indicators such as substance abuse. The CSV is taken from [data.gov](https://data.gov/) rather than the direct source as the raw data formats for YRBSS did not include a CSV.
  - Idea: Hypothesize and analyze how different school-level and state-level policies and norms impact individual behavior and their outcomes. Create a model to predict how particular factors may lead to potential behavioral patterns.
- [Mental Health Diagnosis and Treatment Monitoring](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/mental-health-diagnosis-and-treatment-monitoring)
  - Description: This dataset represents mental health diagnoses, treatments, and their effectiveness. It includes the type of therapy that a patient receives, along with treatment timestamps and their progress, AI-detected emotional state, and treatment outcome.
  - Idea: Analyze the data with emphasis on diagnosis, the type of therapy received, and the physiological symptoms to create visualizations that help to compare and conclude treatment effectiveness among therapy types.
- [Sleep, Health, and Lifestyle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/sleep-health-and-lifestyle-dataset)
  - Description: The Sleep, Health, and Lifestyle dataset monitors sleep and stress levels by measuring factors such as the duration and quality of a participant's sleep, physical activity level, stress level, and sleep disorder(s).
  - Idea: Create a regression plot that compares different variables from this dataset to determine their relationships. To make this easier, we can focus on the impact of the variables on a single factor such as stress level. The regression plot would create a potential predictive model to hypothesize how certain factors would impact our stress levels.

## Data visualization
The following data visualizations are for a course CS 215: Intro to Data Science. They were constructed using a professor's geolocation (with consent), aiming to answer the question "Is the professor's most frequented location within walking distance?"

## Final project for CS 215: Intro to Data Science
This [repository](https://github.com/starrain-hub/CS215.git) is for my final project for the CS 215: Intro to Data Science course. With my partner LJ Friedman, I explored the potential relationship between finance and general happiness in countries all over the world. For the purpose of this project, we decided to focus on four categories for finance: cost of living, health expenditure per capita, annual precipitation, and percentage of land usage for agriculture. We used choroplets, scatterplots, and boxplots to map out our visualizations for the datasets that we have created using CSVs. The CSVs as well as their sources are linked in the project page. We are aware that the categories of finance we have used in this project are just four of a million factors that could impact happiness in the world, but to maintain the scope of this project, we have restrained ourselves to four.
