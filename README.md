## About Me
I am a sophomore ('27) at Whitman College with a prospective combined major in Mathematics-Statistics and a minor in Psychology, with an interest in Criminology. I am a high school graduate of India International School in Japan ('22) and a former Minerva University student ('23). Outside of classes, I explore the field of crime and its statistics through books such as anecdotes of past cases and how statistics are calculated in crimes. I aspire to work with statistics in applications of psychology and/or criminology.
